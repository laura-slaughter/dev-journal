# dev-journal
A collection of data science explorations including code, analysis, and reflections from ongoing projects. The main focus is on data science for the environment — exploring patterns in nature through data.


# Overview of what I am working on
This repository is a dev journal for my data science explorations in environmental and ecological contexts. I experiment with methods using open data, logic-based reasoning, statistical modeling, and machine learning.  I explore how to evaluate data for bias, integrate diverse sources, and build transparent, evidence-based insights through open science practices.
